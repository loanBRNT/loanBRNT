## Who am I?

I am an engineering student (M1) in *Robotic and Interactive System*. Since I was a child, I have admired development in artificial intelligence. After my graduation, I want to poursue **in a thesis around Machine Learning methods**.

My github allows me to list all my projects: from my small personal projects to more complex course projects!
